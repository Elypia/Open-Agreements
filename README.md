# Open Agreements
[![Matrix]][matrix-community] [![Discord]][discord-guild] [![Donate]][elypia-donate]
</div>

As Elypia CIC is a [registered company], we need contracts or
agreements documented on occasion to avoid legal challenges. Where
possible, we like to use openly available licenses or agreements that
already exist but, sometimes we make them ourselves if we don't see
open alternatives available that fit our requirements.

We're hoping as a community we'll be able to create very simple and
flexibly written contracts, that anyone will have the freedom to use,
modify, and redistribute however they want.  

# Disclaimer
Elypia is not a law firm, we do not specialize in legal documents or
writing binding contracts between parties. These documents should be
thoroughly checked before use, and preferably modified to suit your
requirements.

# Documents
All documents are shared in markdown and text form, its recommended to
present them in a format that is most appropriate for your
requirements.

You'll most likely find you'll have to alter or exclude text clauses in
documents to fit your requirements. This repository tries it's best to
separate clauses into sections and sub-sections so it's easy to pick
out and remove to respective statement that may be adverse to your
needs.

Examples may be found in [here], where we've made our own documents.
