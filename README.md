# Open Agreements [![matrix-members]][matrix] [![discord-members]][discord] [![donate-shield]][elypia-donate]
As Elypia CIC is a [registered company], we need contracts or
agreements documented on occasion to avoid legal challenges. Where
possible, we like to use openly available licenses or agreements that
already exist but, sometimes we make them ourselves if we don't see
open alternatives available that fit our requirements.

# Documents
All documents are shared in markdown and text form, it's recommended to
present then in whatever format is most appropriate for your
requirements.

## Open Copyright Transfer Agreement 1.0
The copyright transfer agreement as written in the repository allows
rightsholders of copyrighted material to transfer that copyright to
another entity (organization or person). 

There are two sections:

2a) Transfers all copyright from the rightsholders to the beneficary.

2b) Now that the beneficary has copyright of the material, grant back
the rights to share the work on there website or social media or
reference it for future work.
> Depending on your requirements, you may want to omit or reword 2b.
